      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Jose Mauricio Cabrera Elias, but almost everyone calls
        me 'Joey.' Welcome to my software engineering portfolio. Here you'll get
        to experience some of the apps I have developed. I see things in a
        different way, and I create as such. I think in logic, which makes
        coding come easy to me, and I flow with the code. I also follow to stoic
        way of living, all is Logos. Let me introduce my self. I served in the
        military for twelve years, two branches, first the US Navy and then the
        US Army. Yes, I am a war veteran. I have always loved technology, I like
        to know how things function deep inside. I used to build computers in
        high school(the late 90's) also install software, and troubleshoot on
        family and friends computers. I've was a Gas Turbine electrician
        technician, and in the civilian industry I worked in the process
        engineering industry, that's where I got deep into programming, I
        uploaded and updated software in a field environment. Wrote logic and
        edited for PLC's(Programable Logic controllers) and also a bit of
        robotics. Now, I have found something I'm good at and that's always
        evolving. I love to create. Hopefully you enjoy my work. Thanks for
        visiting!Thank you ðŸ’œ"</p>
